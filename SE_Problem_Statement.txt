SECURE SCAN

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	One-step way to make payments, know about an item, and much more work in one scan the technology of QR code has facilitated us.
	Whenever we scan a QR code it only shows the link and then we can follow that link. But there’s no authenticity check-in whether that link is safe enough because the QR codes are not verified or manufactured by a secured authority. Anyone can generate a QR code within a few seconds with minor steps and this piece of technology can’t be understood by naked human eyes. That can cause the following issues-
Susceptibility to QR code payment frauds,
Vulnerable to redirection to non-secure websites
Bad instructions embedded into the QR code
Misleading QR code
Crooks are altering both digital and physical QR codes and replacing them with malicious code.

SOLUTION:
	Even though QR code scanner is inseparable from our daily life, many of the users are unaware of the dark sides of using this technology. 
	One way solution is to check each and every QR code and its source and authenticity. Scanning all the QR codes around a large area, maintaining a proper database for it, and going through it each time while scanning a code is a laborious task. 
	An easier way would be to automate this task and make it more efficient and feasible by maintaining a middleware database authenticator software. That software will work as a normal QR code scanner and on scanning verifies the code from the database and informs the user whether the code is secure or not.
